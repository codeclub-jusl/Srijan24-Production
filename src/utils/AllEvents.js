"It is an illusion that photos are made with the camera... they are made with the eye, heart, and head.”, said the pioneer of street photography, Henri-Cartier Bresson. So do not think twice about what type of device you own, as long as it is capable of capturing images. Be it a mobile camera, a point-and-shoot, a DSLR, or a mirrorless, we want to see your unique point of view and thought process captured in a frame. This event will consist of budding photographers capturing images on a certain given topic inside the campus. The top 30 images will be selected by the judge, and will be exhibited for public voting. A combination of the judge’s score and public voting will reveal the Top 3 winners.`,
